## An Extensive Exploration of Liquor Licences: A Victorian Perspective

**Abstract:**
Victoria, a southern state in Australia currently has close to 20,000 liquor licences in its suburbs for its 6.2 million residents. These licences range from restaurants and cafes, to bars, pubs, sporting clubs and various other categories. This paper is an exploration of these licences – what type of licences are awarded, where they are, are there differences between metro and regional suburbs, does Melbourne’s “dry area” still exist, and how correlated key demographic factors are to licences.
Liquor data was sourced from Victoria’s Open Data Directory, while demographic data was scraped from the web. Taking inspiration from Wickham and Gromelund, tidy principles were followed in the pre-processing stages required to get the data ready for analysis.
It can be seen that Melbourne the suburb has by far the highest number of licences, while the Local Government Area (LGA) of Melbourne also has the highest number. Interestingly, when the number of licences is normalised by 100,000 of the population, the LGA Alpine has the highest licences per capita. The paper finds that the dry suburbs of Melbourne are only dry in name, with more licences on average in these suburbs than other metro suburbs.
It is hoped this paper will potentially assist town planners in the awarding of future licences, while also forming the basis of any future analyses to model the effects that liquor licensing has on crime rates in the state.
